01 - Introduction

'little languages'/DSLs are everywhere

how well do you really understand how your code works?

SICP has a wizard, Aho, Sethi, Ullman has a dragon - magic!

* (This book is beautiful -- have you seen the code snippets? and the asides! wow!)

human aspects, are, in fact, discussed
  - what makes features easy to learn
  - innovation vs familiarity
  - readability of syntax

* don't assume the guy knows everything, play around with the ideas presented
I do like practical books

bootstrapping - in the compiler world, this is self-compiling (self-hosting) compiler

* you should learn a smattering of Java first

naming things is really hard.

good name criteria:
  1. not in use
  2. pronouncable
  3. distinct (searchable)
  4. no negative connotations
if these fit, use the name. a "unique token" is the only important thing.
hint: cn vs cnfront vs ...!!!
